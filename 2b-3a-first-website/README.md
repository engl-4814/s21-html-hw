# Creating Your First Website

1. Using your code editor, create your own HTML (`.html`) file within the same folder as this file. Use your lastname as the filename in all **lowercase**.
   - Mine would be named `lindgren.html`.
2. Apply your knowledge from the readings and write an HTML page that would be appropriately structured for a web blog. There's certinaly no one right way to complete this assignment, but this should help you consider what elements to use for particular content elements and why.
   - Use a meaningful set of HTML5 block and inline elements to semantically tag your blog post content that includes at least two posts.
   - You do not need to write out the content. Instead, you can use the placeholder resources that we reviewed in class, such as the lorem ipsum text generator in VS Code, or placeholder.com for images, e.g., [https://via.placeholder.com/50x50](https://via.placeholder.com/50x50)
