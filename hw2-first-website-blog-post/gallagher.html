            <h2 align="center">How The Creative Journey Started</h2>
            <p align="center">Summer of 2016 I found an old crochet bikini in a drawer at my grandmothers cabin in Norway.
                The bikini was a mustard yellow vintage style piece, so old that the elastic had long since rotted.
                Could I make something like this? I wondered. It was summer and I had plenty of time on my hands.
                Signe, my great aunt, was and still is a master crocheter and knitter. 
                The next day I biked over to her house on the top of the hill.
                Signa is a warm lady, always happy for company. She welcomed me in with a strong hug and was delighted to hear of my mission.
                Her teaching style was strict and I learned quickly how to put the stitches together.</p>
            <p align="center">Chain stitch</p>
            <p align="center">Single crochet</p>
            <p align="center">Double crochet</p>
            <p align="center">Eager to start, I immediately started on my first piece: A simple cotton bralette.
                I was hooked. I spent the next 6 months feverishly crochetting, learning with every project.
                By the spring time the next year I was crocheting every day in class to keep my hand occupied.
                My classmates took notice and interest in purchasing my pieces grew. 
                That spring season I was blessed and sold almost 50 tops to girls in my highschool.
                I started fantasizing about growing and upgrading my business...
