# Creating Your First Website: A blog page

1. Using your code editor, create your own HTML (`.html`) file within the same folder as this file. Use your lastname as the filename in all **lowercase**.
   - Mine would be named `lindgren.html`.
2. Apply your knowledge from the James and Simmons and write an HTML page that would be an appropriately structured set of content design elements for a web blog.
   - **Required**: Use the 5 block elements that Simmons reviews to structure the main parts of the blog page. Then, use the most semantically meaningful elements for everything else.
   - **Required**: Use a meaningful set of HTML5 block and inline elements to semantically tag your blog post content that includes at least two posts.
   - There's certinaly no one right way to complete this assignment. This assignment is your first task to analyze the generic content elements of a blog page and meaningfully consider what elements to use for particular content elements and why.
   - Be sure to make it a complete page with a doctype declaration, head, and body.
   - Practice truly considering what elements are nested inside other elements and indenting them accordingly.
   - You do not need to write out the content. Instead, you can use the placeholder resources that we reviewed in class, such as the lorem ipsum text generator in VS Code.
   - If you want to jump ahead and use images, you can use placeholder.com for images, e.g., [https://via.placeholder.com/50x50](https://via.placeholder.com/50x50)
