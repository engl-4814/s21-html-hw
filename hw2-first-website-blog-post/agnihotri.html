                    <p>There are many ingredients to designing a perfect race track</p>
                    <p>Meeting the FIA's licensing standard is the most important requirement. But that doesn't make it <em>exciting.</em></p>
                    <p>A circuit needs to have varying degrees of elevation and high speed corners that push upwards of 3G's testing the
                    limits of every cars perfromance. It should test the driver's ability to mainain focus and work through the multiple gear shifts every lap.

                    <h2>What makes a track <mark>boring</mark>?</h2>
                    <p>A track with endless left-handers designed to just fit around the pit garages giving a repetitive feel is just an invitation for a <strong>snoozefest!</strong></p>
                    <p> The perfect example for such a racetrack is the Sochi Autodrome in Russia. </p>
