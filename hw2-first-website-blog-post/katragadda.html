            <p>Nolan successfully directs the hardest movie to understand till date. Atleast for me.
            Tenet is a hard movie to connect with in terms of emotion or story.
            Its also the first movie to use time bending realities without actually travelling in time. (You'll know when you watch it)</p>

            <p>This movie is the reason why I love animated movies.
            We can mould animated movies to potray the imagination without any restraint.
            The story, character development, the animation, emotional connection, everything is just well connected
            Main premise of this movie is how one feels the need to have a purpose in life and knowing what that is.</p>
