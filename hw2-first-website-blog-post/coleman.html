          <h1 align="center">Are you ready to get a dog?</h1>
          <p align="center"> Getting a dog is not as <em>easy</em> as some people make it out to be. 
              If you have not thought much about the work of a dog, then start thinking. 
              Raising a puppy means waking up during the night to make sure your puppy does not pee in the house. 
              If you have never house trained a dog, then you do not know the work that is necessary to get a puppy. 
              I have developed this blog to help teach people information about dog training. </p>
