# hw1-commit-push-practice

## First practice commit and push

1. Using your code editor, create your own MarkDown (.md) file within the same folder as this file. Use your lastname as the filename in all **lowercase**.
   - Mine would be named `lindgren.md`.
   - **NOTE**: We use all lowercase, since HTML, CSS, and their accompanying filenaming schemes rarely use uppercase and glottic-based capitalizatioon schemes. Consider how difficult it would be to remember all the different ways people on your team capitalize filenames and code keywords and names. Not fun!
2. Markup some content with some simple `HTML`. (HTML also works in markdown files.)
   - This is <strong>bolded text</strong>.
   - This is <em>emphasized text</em>.
3. Save it in your code editor.
4. To submit your work, navigate to your Github Desktop app.
5. Review and Commit the changes to the gh-pages branch.
6. Push your work to the shared repo on Github.
   - **NOTE**: You may need to "Fetch" changes, since others will be submitting their files. Desktop should prompt you to do so, if needed.

## Commenting on the code on Github

1. Let's walk through how to comment on someone's pushed code online. Some key things to practice:
   1. Knowing where to navigate and what you're reviewing.
   2. Finding something to comment on.
   3. Tagging your peer with the person's GH handle.
2. After reviewing the comments, 
   1. Make thoose changes to your code, 
   2. Commit those changes to the branch, and 
   3. Push them to the repo on GH.
